Follow the 'TemplateCode.cpp' for an example of how to implement the 4 point RungeKutta
algorithm into your own .cpp code.  A brief description of the variables and their data
types can be found in the header file RungeKutta.h

To compile your code, open the MakeFile with your favorite text editor and replace
'TemplateCode' with the name of your own .cpp file, then type 'make' in the terminal.
From here, you can execute using ./your_code_name.x
