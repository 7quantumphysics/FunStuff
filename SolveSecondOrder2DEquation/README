Follow the 'TemplateCode.cpp' for an example of how to implement the 4 point RungeKutta
algorithm into your own .cpp code.  A brief description of the variables and their data
types can be found in the header file RungeKutta.h

This RungeKutta is a copy of the 'SolveSecondOrderEquation' directory that allows for
second order derivatives that rely on two independant functions that must be updated
along every time step.  An example problem for this would be a 'simple' double pendulum
problem or a two body orbit.

(In General, one can edit these RK functions to include as many independant functions as
need be for the problem at hand.)

To compile your code, open the MakeFile with your favorite text editor and replace
'TemplateCode' with the name of your own .cpp file, then type 'make' in the terminal.
From here, you can execute using ./your_code_name.x
